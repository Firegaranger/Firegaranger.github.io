## Recap

I was looking on Creative Circle on [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/web-developer-creative-circle-JV_IC1131270_KO0,13_KE14,29.htm?jl=2571494263&ctt=1512689471630). I was following their [tutorial] (https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.17.0/tutorial/ember-cli/) and it was about creating a rental property page, and was only able to get it to work on my localhost and couldn't figure out how to get it on the server. Ember was cool to use with all the different way to route your pages together. Ember is something I would like to look more in the future.
