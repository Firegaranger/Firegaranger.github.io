## Recap

This was my first time trying ReactJS. There was a lot of trouble when I was trying to get it to work. Downloads wasn't working, node wasn't the right version, and etc. I was able to overcome these problems by trying out different sudo apt-install, curl, brew, and yarn. I eventually was able to get it working with the hlpe of the TA. I found help from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43517963/running-react-application-in-aws-ec2-server) and [How to install Node JS](https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-npm-on-ubuntu/).
