## Recap

So I explored more of NodeJS mysql by using W3School examples. I explored how to delete and select a certain characteristic from a table. Also, sorting it ascending or descending. I followed the same website to explore these features. From what I can tell its not much different compare to regular mysql, just its JavaScript. So for delete, I just deleted a person with a certain address, "Moutain 21". I sort it by first name, and I selected a person with the address, "Park Lane 38".

## Recap

I believe ReactJS was front-end JavaScript. So I explored some back-end stuff and I stuck with NodeJS mysql. I follwed [Tutorial for nodejs mysql](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mysql.asp) to get mysql and nodejs working. I had a little knowledge on mysql and was trying it out with nodejs. All I did was follow w3schools tutorial on the option on the left side. I was a little worried if I didn't install it right so I looked at [Help with installation](https://medium.com/technoetics/installing-and-setting-up-mysql-with-nodejs-in-ubuntu-75e0c0a693ba) for help to check if I had the right version. I don't know how to link it to a webpage since it wasn't in the tutorial.

## Recap

This was my first time trying ReactJS. There was a lot of trouble when I was trying to get it to work. Downloads wasn't working, node wasn't the right version, and etc. I was able to overcome these problems by trying out different sudo apt-install, curl, brew, and yarn. ReactJS look very interesting to me and it looks very challenging. I eventually was able to get it working with the help of the TA. I found help from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43517963/running-react-application-in-aws-ec2-server) and [How to install Node JS](https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-npm-on-ubuntu/).

My first attempt was me following [React JS tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) to create a tic-tac-toe game and it was pretty eye opening to how different it is. I ended up with errors and having to fix it. The most challenging part of this expoloration was trying to get the app to show up on the webpage. TA and I looked up how to do it, and we figured out we need to change the DocumentRoot to the build of the app.
